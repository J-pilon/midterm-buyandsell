# requirements
* users can favourite items to check up on them later
  I think it would be good enough if the user favorites a song after they have purchased it
* users can send messages to the artist that is listing the item
  - I think the easiest way to solve this is have a message board
  - so user posts on message board signed to an artist
  - ? would that mean we need another spot in the database for messages?
  - or could we do it as a POST request and just display it on the artist page
* mark items as SOLD!
  - this could be done with an easy counter - just like the counter for tweeter
  - it wouldnt show sold, just how many ppl have purchased the song

## Home page
*** mark items as SOLD!
  - this could be done with an easy counter - just like the counter for tweeter
